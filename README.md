Generally, data analysts may a lot more time connecting to business stakeholders, while data scientists are more coding intensive. Data engineers usually have less focus on machine learning/algorithms-related tasks. The titles can be interchanged in some job descriptions, and responsibilities also depend on the industry and project. But it's still quite helpful when we plan the path.
